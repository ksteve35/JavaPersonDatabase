# JavaPersonDatabase
Hello! The JavaPersonDatabase project is being written as a way to refamiliarize myself with Java concepts, GUI building, JSON file handling, and sorting algorithms. The project currently holds an internal database holding objects called Records. Records contain data about the people they contain, such as first and last names, middle name initials, ages, heights, weights, and unique ID numbers, as well as whether or not the people are married or deceased.

# Existing Features
- Add a new Record
- Edit a preexisting Record
- Delete a preexisting Record
- Print out the Records in the order of which they were added
- Save your Database in a JSON file
- Load a Database from a JSON file

# Planned Features
- Ability to sort by first name, last name, or ID number in ascending or descending order
- Code testing!!!
- Might change "age" variable in Records to be dateOfBirth and programmatically calculate the person's age
